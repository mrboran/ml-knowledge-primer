## Docs

The website that documents the whole repository is hoster at [mrboran.github.io/ml-knowledge-primer](https://mrboran.github.io/ml-knowledge-primer/).

To deployment the latest version of docs run the following:

```shell
GIT_USER=<> yarn deploy
```

There are pages, docs and blog posts in docusours that can be used. You can also change
the side, but I am not intersted in that. It is so because it adds complexity.

> you can also use mdx for improve the presentation of the a document.
